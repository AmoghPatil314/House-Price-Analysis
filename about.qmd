Hello! I am a upcoming 10th grade student at Blaine High School in Minnesota. My github is https://github.com/AmoghPatil314, and my email is amogh@arjunp.com

This project is a website that uses brm models to predict and analyse house prices. It also has a bunch of graphs, some about the data and some about the model.

This project was created as a part of Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp (https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
